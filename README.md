# FlightMap for Turtle WoW
Copy of https://github.com/TrangOul/FlightMap with the AI generated addition of adding Turtle WoW flight masters as they are discovered.

I am testing as I play, but so far this is a working version. I expect that many of the existing flight times will be adjusted with this addon as you discover more flight paths and because of the way registering flight times work in this verison.

Summary:
- Relearns flight times as you use new/unkonwn flight lines.
- Adds Turtle WoW-specific flight masters as they are discovered. Note: Does not pre-show flight masters that are specific to Turtle WoW. Upon first load, FlightMap will generate unkonwn, Turtle-specific nodes.
